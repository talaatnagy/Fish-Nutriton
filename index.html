                    <p>Fish Feeding, mainly farmed fish, has been a highly controversial topic; it poses a significant challenge for sustainable development of the aquaculture sector. The 21st century has been plagued with rising temperatures due to the effects of global warming. Going green is the ‘mantra’ as efforts are geared to saving the planet. As more people are looking for ways of sustainable living, animals are not left behind. Fish being one of them, people want to know if their source of foods are sustainable and do not cause adverse effects to the environment. Significantly reducing the environmental footprint of aquaculture is top on the agenda; thus, organic fish food must be farmed or captured in manners that take into account the long-term sustainability and vitality of the farmed species and the marine environment, and the livelihoods of fish-reliant communities.  Incorporating algae fish food is another vital application that improves the sustainability of fish feeds. Research has shown that algae in the fish meal have a positive impact on the fish’s growth performance. Using sustainable methods for making fish feed will boost its supply; this is significant as it will also ensure there is a constant supply of fish for human consumption. It’s a win-win situation for everyone.
